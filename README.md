# Loggly.Extensions.Logging
Loggly.Extensions.Logging

An extension to .NET Core Loggly to send logs to Loggly. This branch is currently broken. There is a reference conflict when adding it to my project.
I'm no 100% what the issue is yet b/c I'm still not 100% clear on how all the different frameworks and their references work with .NET Core.
